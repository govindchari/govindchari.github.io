My name is Govind Chari. I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I interned at SpaceX
last summer in the Propulsion Analysis group. This summer I will be returning to SpaceX where I will be interning in the Guidance, Navigation, and Controls group for the Dragon spacecraft. In the fall, I will be starting my PhD in the [Autonomous Controls Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/uwacl/) at the University of Washington advised by Professor Behçet Açikmeşe.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
