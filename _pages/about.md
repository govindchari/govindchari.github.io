Currently I am interning at SpaceX in the Guidance, Navigation, and Controls group for the Dragon spacecraft. 
I am a PhD student in the [Autonomous Controls Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/uwacl/) at the University of Washington advised by Professor [Behçet Açikmeşe](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese). I am interested in trajectory optimization, numerical optimization, numeric methods, developing simulations, and writing performance software. My resume can be found [here](../assets/pdf/Govind_Chari_Resume.pdf).

I graduated *summa cum laude* from Cornell University in three years with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. I also recieved the Sibley Prize, which is awarded to the graduating MechE senior with the highest cumulative GPA.
