I am a PhD student in the [Autonomous Controls Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/uwacl/) at the University of Washington advised by Professor [Behçet Açıkmeşe](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese). My interests are high-speed optimization and its applications, especially online trajectory optimization. 

I graduated *summa cum laude* from Cornell University in three years with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. I also received the Sibley Prize, which is awarded to the graduating mechanical engineering student with the highest cumulative GPA. For the summer of 2023, I will be interning at SpaceX on the [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) Topology team in Redmond, WA.

I have completed two internships at SpaceX: Propulsion Analysis for [Raptor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0t6_l3x-f8) and Guidance, Navigation, and Controls for [Dragon](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/dragon/). My resume can be found [here](../assets/pdf/Govind_Chari_Resume.pdf).
