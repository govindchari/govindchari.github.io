I recently graduated *summa cum laude* from Cornell University in three years with a BS in Mechanical Engineering, and am currently interning at SpaceX in the Guidance, Navigation, and Controls group for the Dragon spacecraft. 

In the fall, I will be starting my PhD in the [Autonomous Controls Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/uwacl/) at the University of Washington advised by Professor [Behçet Açikmeşe](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese).

I am interested in trajectory optimization, numerical optimization, numeric methods, developing simulations, and writing performance software. My resume can be found [here](../assets/pdf/Govind_Chari_Resume.pdf).
