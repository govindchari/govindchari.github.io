I am a PhD student in the [Autonomous Controls Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/uwacl/) at the University of Washington advised by Professor [Behçet Açıkmeşe](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese). My interests are high-speed optimization and its applications, especially online trajectory optimization. 

I graduated *summa cum laude* from Cornell University in three years with a BS in Mechanical Engineering, and received the Sibley Prize, which is awarded to the graduating mechanical engineering student with the highest cumulative GPA. I have completed three internships at SpaceX: Network Topology for [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/), Guidance, Navigation, and Controls for [Dragon](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/dragon/), and Propulsion Analysis for [Raptor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0t6_l3x-f8).

I will be interning on the Guidance, Navigation, and Control team at [Anduril](https://www.anduril.com/) during the summer of 2024 and will be interning with [Dr. Arvind Raghunathan](https://www.merl.com/people/raghunathan) at [Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs](https://www.merl.com/) during the fall of 2024 where I will be researching optimization algorithms.
