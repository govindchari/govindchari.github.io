My name is Govind Chari. I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I interned at SpaceX
last summer in the Propulsion Analysis group, and this summer I will be returning to SpaceX where I will be interning in the Guidance, Navigation, and Controls group for the Dragon spacecraft. In the fall, I will be starting my PhD in the [Autonomous Controls Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/uwacl/) at the University of Washington advised by Professor [Behçet Açikmeşe](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese). My resume can be found [here](../assets/pdf/Govind_Chari_Resume.pdf).

I am interested in trajectory planning, optimization, autonomous systems, developing simulations, and math.
