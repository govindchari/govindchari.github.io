I am a PhD student in the [Autonomous Controls Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/uwacl/) at the University of Washington advised by Professor [Behçet Açıkmeşe](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese). My research interests are optimization theory and high-performance implementations of optimization algorithms, and I am generally interested in computers and how to extract maximum performance from them.

I graduated _summa cum laude_ from Cornell University in three years with a BS in Mechanical Engineering, and received the [Sibley Prize](https://www.mae.cornell.edu/mae/programs/undergraduate-programs/graduation-ceremony/awards), which is awarded to the graduating mechanical engineering student with the highest cumulative GPA.

I have completed three internships at SpaceX: Network Topology for [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/), Guidance, Navigation, and Controls for [Dragon](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/dragon/), and Propulsion Analysis for [Raptor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0t6_l3x-f8) an internship at [Anduril](https://www.anduril.com/) on the Guidance, Navigation, and Control team where I worked on trajectory optimization, and am currently interning with [Dr. Arvind Raghunathan](https://www.merl.com/people/raghunathan) at [Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs](https://www.merl.com/) where I am researching optimization algorithms.
