I am a PhD student in the [Autonomous Controls Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/uwacl/) at the University of Washington advised by Professor [Behçet Açikmeşe](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese). My interests lie in optimization theory, writing high-speed optimization algorithms, and applications of optimization such as path planning and machine learning. 

I graduated *summa cum laude* from Cornell University in three years with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. I also recieved the Sibley Prize, which is awarded to the graduating MechE senior with the highest cumulative GPA.

I have completed two internships at SpaceX: Propulsion Analysis for Raptor and Guidance, Navigation, and Controls for [Dragon](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/dragon/). My resume can be found [here](../assets/pdf/Govind_Chari_Resume.pdf).
