## Introduction
In this blog post I will go through how I became interested in optimization and started to learn it, as well as reflect upon what worked, what did not, what I would do differently, and how I would recommend studying it. I recognize that I am far from an expert on optimization and there is a lot left for me to learn, but I think I am qualified enough to give advice on how to approach learning the subject.
