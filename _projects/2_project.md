For my final project in ECE 5555: Stochastic Control and Estimation, I recreated Behçet Açıkmeşe and Lars Blackmore's [G-FOLD](/assets/pdf/gfold_paper.pdf) algorithm in a C++ simulation. You can find my code [here](https://github.com/govindchari/nsim) and my report [here](/assets/pdf/ECE5555 Final Paper.pdf).
