For my final project for MAE 6760: Model-Based Estimation, I wrote a 6DOF physics simulation for a high powered rocket and an Unscented Kalman Filter for position, velocity, and attitude estimation using an accelerometer, gyroscope, and a GPS. You can find my code [here](https://github.com/govindchari/Rocket-UKF) and my report [here](/assets/pdf/MAE_6760_Final_Report.pdf).
