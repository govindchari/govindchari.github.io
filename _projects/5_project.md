A 6DOF simulation in Simulink for a Thrust Vectoring Model Rocket. This simulation accounts for TVC misalignment, actuator lag, saturation, and other non-ideal effects. These parameters were dispersed to run a Monte-Carlo simulation. My code can be found [here](https://github.com/govindchari/6DOF-Model-Rocket-Simulation).
