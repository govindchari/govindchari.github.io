For my final project for MAE 4780: Feedback Controls, I created a 3DOF Simulink simulation for a thrust vectoring VTOL Rocket and designed a full-state feedback controller and an Extended Kalman Filter for control and estimation. You can find my code [here](https://github.com/govindchari/3DOF-TVC-Simulation) and my report [here](/assets/pdf/MAE_4780_Final_Report.pdf).
